     # MySQL database
     DB_HOST= YOUR_HOST
     DB_PORT=3306
     DB_USER= YOUR_USERNAME
     DB_PASS= YOUR_PASSWORD
     DB_NAME= YOUR_DATABASE_NAME
     ```
   
4. **Set Up and Run the Backend:**
   - Install backend dependencies and start the server:
   ```
   $ cd KaleMeMaybe/backend
   $ npm install
   $ npm start
   ```

## Deployment

"Kale Me Maybe" is deployed across several AWS services, working together to provide a scalable, secure, and responsive experience:

<img width="637" alt="image" src="https://github.com/UOA-CS732-SE750-Students-2024/project-group-dapper-dolphins/assets/89385715/9f942935-fcf2-48aa-97c5-66e267041f04">

1. **Frontend: AWS S3 and CloudFront**  
   - **AWS S3:** Hosts static frontend files, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - **AWS CloudFront:** Serves as a global content delivery network (CDN) in front of S3, caching static assets at edge locations to provide faster content delivery to users.

2. **Backend and API: AWS EC2 and Elastic Beanstalk**  
   - **AWS EC2:** Hosts backend services and APIs to handle user requests.
   - **Elastic Beanstalk:** Manages EC2 instances, orchestrating scaling, load balancing, and deployment for efficient backend management.

3. **Database: AWS RDS**  
   - **AWS RDS (MySQL):** Provides a managed MySQL database, storing user data, recipes, and other dynamic content.

4. **Data Flow Overview:**  
   - Users access the application through CloudFront, which fetches static content from S3.
   - Dynamic requests (e.g., personalized recipes) are handled by the backend APIs hosted on EC2.
   - The backend interacts with the RDS database to retrieve or update user data and returns the results via the API.
   - Elastic Beanstalk ensures the backend services remain scalable, stable, and up-to-date.

- **Repository**: [Dapper Dolphins - Github](https://github.com/UOA-CS732-SE750-Students-2024/project-group-dapper-dolphins)
- **Branch Naming Guidelines**: 
	- main: always reflects a production-ready state
	- feature branch: username-filename-committype-date (one feature branch should at most live for one day), eg. 'tina-recipedetail-addresponsive-0430'
- **Commit Message Guidelines**:
	- Start with a short, descriptive summary in the imperative mood, e.g., "Add", "Fix".
Use a blank line separating the summary from any detailed explanation if necessary.
	- Reference issue IDs if applicable, e.g., "Fix issue 19".
	- Example: git commit -m "Implement user profile caching\n\nThis update adds caching to user profile data to improve loading times. Addresses performance concerns raised in issue #123."
